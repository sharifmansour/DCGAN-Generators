# DCGAN-Generators
 Exploring the Latent Space of DCGAN Generators.
 
The following code is meant to recreate the outcome from the original deep convolutional generative adversarial networks paper on their aim at exploring the latent space through arithmetic operations.

- Was run using tensorflow 2.0.0 and cuda 10.2. 
- Provided file should be fine to run on it's own and can be run easily through Spyder (Python 3.6).
- Please be mindful to update the folder path for the newly created images and training data.
- Training data source will be provided for download.
